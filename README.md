# git stash

This is a toy example of using git stash create in a script to automate stashing.
The script moves your local changes from the current branch to a target branch.

Try out the script

```sh

bash stash-move.sh <branch_name>

```

`<branch_name>` is the name of the branch you want to move your local changes to.
It can be any existing branch that isn't the current branch.
